I will leave technical notes about artificial intelligence, software engineering and more. In the years to come, I would like to be a <strong>“full-stack” MLE</strong> , skilled in general machine learning, recommendation, computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, auto-pilot, and related development skills. Keep it up!!!</p><p>The last but not the least, there will be a “Zoom Out” blog definitely, which focuses on ideas and thoughts in a bigger picture beyond technology. It’s said that the more you get versent in technical skills, the less you think with scope and dimension. Hope it will help me think out of the box as not only an engineer, but also an innovator.</p>]]></content>
